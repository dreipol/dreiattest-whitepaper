Headers (in addition to the [common headers](common_headers.md)):  
> "Dreiattest-uid": "hello@example.com;123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"  

Response: random 32-byte hex Data as JSON  
e.g. "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"

Get a nonce (snonce) for registering a key. Only one nonce per uid can be valid at a given point in time. The mobile libraries, therefore, have to ensure that a key is only generated and registered once even when multiple requests are initiated at the same time.

## POST /dreiattest/key
Headers (in addition to the [common headers](common_headers.md)):  
> "Dreiattest-uid": "hello@example.com;123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"  
> "Dreiattest-nonce": "<snonce>"  

Body:  
```json
{
    "public_key": "AAAAc3...", // Android
    "key_id": "AAAAc3...", // iOS
    "attestation": "o2NmbX...", //attestation object provied by the platform specific service
    "driver": "apple|google"
}
```

Registers a key. The nonce required by DeviceCheck / SafetyNet is calculated as
```
nonce = sha256(uid :: pubkey :: snonce).
```
